# Concurrency Workshop

This repository coincides with an Introduction to Concurrency with Elixir
workshop.

1) Install Elixir: http://elixir-lang.github.io/install.html

2) Git - A working version of git (https://git-scm.com/downloads)

There is also a video for installing Elixir: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=antnsMgA4Ro

We do not introduce the Elixir language itself, so some familiarity with the
language itself is expected. If you are new to Elixir, working through the first
nine sections of this tutorial should help you gain enough working knowledge:
